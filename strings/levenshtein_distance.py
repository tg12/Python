"""
This is a Python implementation of the levenshtein distance.
Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the
difference between two sequences.

For doctests run following command:
python -m doctest -v levenshtein-distance.py
or
python3 -m doctest -v levenshtein-distance.py

For manual testing run:
python levenshtein-distance.py
